Columns Clone
=============

Columns (old match-3 game) clone written in Lua using Love2d (http://love2d.org)

Currently you can "play" the game by moving with the arrow keys and dropping your active piece with space.
Try to match three of the same color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


Major work in progress.
